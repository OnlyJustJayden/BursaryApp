# 💰 C# Bursary App Prototype  

This project was developed for the **2023 NMU Computer Society Hackathon**, where teams of five were challenged to solve a real-world problem. **Team Kappa** took on the challenge of addressing financial accessibility in higher education by building a **bursary assistance app**.  

## 🏆 Project Overview  

Our **C# Windows Forms** application was designed to help college students **find funding opportunities** while also providing **financial literacy resources**. The app features:  

- 📋 A **list of available bursaries** at a college level.  
- 📖 A **financial terminology section** to educate students on funding-related concepts.  
- 🌙 A **dark green and gold aesthetic**, giving the app a professional yet modern feel.  
- 🔑 A **login system (mockup)**, demonstrating how users might access personalized features in a full version.  

Since this was a **hackathon prototype**, many features were mockups and did not perform full backend functions, but they effectively showcased the **concept and UI** of the app.  

## 🛠️ Built With  

- **C# Windows Forms** 🖥️  
- **Dark Green & Gold UI Theme** 🎨  
- **Visual Studio** 🏗️

## 🎯 The Goal  

The bursary app was created to **simplify the funding search process** for students by providing:  

✅ A **centralized bursary database**  
✅ An **easy-to-navigate interface**  
✅ **Financial literacy tools** to help students **manage their funding responsibly**  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

If this project were to be expanded, we would consider:  

- **Live bursary updates** using an API or database integration.  
- **User authentication & profile management** for tracking applications.  
- **Advanced financial planning tools** like budgeting and expenditure tracking.  

## 🏅 Acknowledgments
